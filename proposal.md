## Project Proposal
**Markdown Editing Server**
For my project, I would like to develop a markdown note editing server. The express purpose of this server would be to allow multiple users to view notes at once, while only allowing one user to edit at a time. To achieve this, I will have to implement a critical section for files being edited and a synchronization mechanism to update files once edited. In addition, the server will use multithreading, giving each connected user a unique thread.
